title: Book Recommendations
categories: [Data Science, Machine Learning]
---


Last week I posted a picture of my data science library (below) and asked for recommendations on great books that I'm missing.

The response was completely overwhelming! 

Thank you all for sharing! 

In an attempt to give back, I combed through the comments to list, categorize, and link all recommendations. It wasn't always clear which book should go into which category or even which categories to include, but I did my best.

Enjoy!
